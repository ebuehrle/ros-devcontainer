ROS Melodic on Ubuntu Bionic with [non-root user](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-advanced#_adding-a-nonroot-user-to-your-dev-container) `vscode` and connected X server. The local user must be a [member of the group `docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) and [X must be set to allow the connection](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xhost), the easiest way being to do `xhost +`.
